# How To Contribute To Sherlock
First off, thank you for the help!

There are many ways to contribute.  Here is some high level grouping.

## Adding New Sites

Please look at the Wiki entry on
[adding new sites](https://github.com/TheYahya/sherlock/wiki/Adding-Sites-To-Sherlock)
to understand the issues.

Any new sites that are added need to have a username that has been claimed, and one
that is unclaimed documented in the site data.  This allows the regression tests
to ensure that everything is working.

## Adding New Functionality

Please ensure that the content on your branch passes all tests before submitting a pull request.
